bulild-script should be run in bash using the command "./build-script". This script builds two images kilo/iss_2021-db_i:latest and kilo/iss_2021-web_i:latest.

first the script changes directory so the docker build commands only have to specify a file path one directory deep
cd ../builds/

Then this command builds the web server image from the dockerfile in the db directory. This image  when built is called kilo/iss_2021-web_i.
docker build db/ -t kilo/iss_2021-db_i:latest

After the db image has been built the web image is then built using the docker file in the web directory. This image when built is called kilo/iss_2021-web_i
docker build web/ -t kilo/iss_2021-web_i:latest

Inside the respective image folders is the a file called DockerfileEdited from our stripping attempt as well as the original Dockerfiles.
If a working solution is needed to be tested than the original ones should be used. This is because we couldnâ€™t get a working solution with the edited ones

This line takes the script back to the directory it started in.
cd ../scripts/

Once the images have been built, the stripping scripts can be ran. 
strip-db.sh creates a stripped database image and strip-web.sh creates a stripped web server image. 
These scripts need to ran in the same directory as strip-image.sh.

Unfortunately, we could not get the stripping to work correctly and both result in errors. 
The log of these errors can be found in the respective image folders under stripped_log.txt
